The new room I found has been great so far, except for the window which has been steadily leaking wonderfully frigid January air into my bedroom. Time to call maintenance. It was fortuitous, you could say, that this broken window would bring Leonard into my life for a brief but lasting moment.<br><br>As Leonard inspected both of the windows his eyes caught a picture on my desk of my three friends and I, celebrating a birthday together a few years back.<br><br>“Are these boys your friends?” Leonard asked.<br><br>“Yes sir, more like brothers you could say.”<br><br>“Known them for a while?”<br><br>“Since before I can remember, honestly.”<br><br>He obviously was moved by something. His somberness was striking and the weight on his soul seemed immense. Leonard, it turns out, has a teenage son.<br><br>“My boy had friends like yours his whole life. Good kids. But recently he’s started hanging with the wrong crew.”<br><br>It turns out that his son started spending time with a pretty bad group of individuals, the kind that can veer you in the wrong direction rapidly; losing focus on the important things at perhaps the most critical time in your young life.<br><br>I was patiently listening to Leonard chat as he worked on the broken window, while also trying to pay attention to a conference call I had on speakerphone in the background. That’s when Leonard told me that during a scuffle within the group, his son was shot. Seven times.<br><br>“I’m sorry - did you say it was your son that was shot?”<br><br>He just stopped his work and looked at me, with the kind of look you don’t want to see in a parent’s eyes.<br><br>I had what felt like a terrifying choice to make; do I ask if his son survived?<br><br>“Please…please tell me he is ok.” How could he possibly be?<br><br>Leonard told me that his son did miraculously survive, but his son is now paralyzed from the waist down.<br><br>Call it a symptom of growing up in suburbia, but I don’t exactly know too many people who have been wounded by gunfire. I only have movies to give me any idea of what such a scene might look like; how it might impact the individuals and their loved ones. All I can say for sure is that Leonard was in pain, and he’s been carrying it every day for half of a year knowing the disaster that has shattered his son’s life.<br><br>I didn’t know what to say. There are, I have just learned, actually times when words are meaningless. I did the only thing that I thought might help. I gave Leonard a big hug.<br><br>Here we were, two grown men in the middle of the day, with a business meeting phonecall for background ambiance, embracing each other.<br><br>We talked about his son for a while longer, talking about his prognosis, spirits, and health. We also talked about the neighborhood and where he raised his son and how strikingly different it was from where he worked. He told me he is sometimes bewildered by how peaceful the East Village can be in comparison; seeing kids playing basketball together and having innocent fun. It was clear that it eats away at him to know that his part of town is tearing its own to pieces over pointless feuds.<br><br>Leonard had fixed the window by now and was packing up his tools to head out. I wished him and his son luck and let him know that I would be breaking my window soon to make sure I got an update on him and his son. He laughed.<br><br>Leonard left. I won’t remember a single damn thing from that business call, but I certainly can never forget the things I talked about with the maintenance man.<br></p>
