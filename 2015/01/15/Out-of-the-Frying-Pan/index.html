Time was running out not because spots were dwindling, but because of the amount of prework I had to complete in order to attend the cohort starting in January. He wasn’t kidding.</p>
<p></p><p><br>I’ve lost count of the amount of hours I’ve put into studying, but the last twenty days have been an absolute blur. I’m back in undergrad mode, consuming every source of information, class, manual, and blog post I can possibly find to get up to speed on programming in Javascript, the lingua franca of both the course and the internet.</p>
<p></p><p><br>Programming, like other sciences, is tough. The smallest mistake can shut down one hundred per cent of your solution. Getting ninety-nine per cent of the way there sure feels like zero when your program isn’t working at all. I’m trying my best to channel that frustration into a fire to keep learning and getting stronger.</p>
<p></p><p><br>Learning programming feels a bit like learning to play an instrument. You mash your fingers on the instrument all you want one day, producing horrifying sounds, hoping that it’ll get better and that your neighbors won’t call the cops (…maybe not that part). Dejectedly you toss the damn thing aside as your blood pressure peaks and you call it a night. The next day though, your fingers move with just a bit less resistance, and so it goes. Small, almost unnoticeable improvements, adding to one another.</p>
