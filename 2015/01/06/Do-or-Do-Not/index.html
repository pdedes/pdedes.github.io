I think I became interested in finally learning how to develop software after seeing so many simple ideas catch like wildfire in people’s imaginations. It’s a seductive idea to believe that an idea can be broadcast to millions so easily today - something that was unfathomable but only a century ago.</p>
<p></p><p><br>I think Fullstack will be a significant challenge, but a worthwhile one. I have always had a strong respect for the builders, not the talkers. It’s important to me for that reason to become a builder myself, and a spectator no longer.<br>That being said, what do I want to build? I’m interested in education, transportation, entertainment (films specifically), and music. I definitely have ideas in each of those categories, but they all need further development. I love tools that make tedious processes much more fluid, efficient, and if possible: automated. I’ll keep an eye open as I learn more about software development.</p>
<p></p><p><br>Regarding my current career as a management consultant; I work with software engineering teams all the time. Quite amazingly, a lot of them work without quality standards, in poorly managed environments, and with very bad leadership. Often times, I am responsible for implementing these governance models on teams that don’t have any, so learning the art of software development seems like the logical next step for me in my current career. I think it is profoundly more relevant than other graduate degrees.</p>
<p></p><p><br>Regardless of where this takes me, I am excited about the possibilities.<br>Action versus observation… Always.</p>
