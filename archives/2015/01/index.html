        <p>When I was accepted into the program one of the founders, Nimit, made it clear that I had to make my decision quickly. Time was running out not because spots were dwindling, but because of the amount of prework I had to complete in order to attend the cohort starting in January. He wasn’t kidding.<br>I’ve lost count of the amount of hours I’ve put into studying, but the last twenty days have been an absolute blur. I’m back in undergrad mode, consuming every source of information, class, manual, and blog post I can possibly find to get up to speed on programming in Javascript, the lingua franca of both the course and the internet.<br>Programming, like other sciences, is tough. The smallest mistake can shut down one hundred per cent of your solution. Getting ninety-nine per cent of the way there sure feels like zero when your program isn’t working at all. I’m trying my best to channel that frustration into a fire to keep learning and getting stronger.<br>Learning programming feels a bit like learning to play an instrument. You mash your fingers on the instrument all you want one day, producing horrifying sounds, hoping that it’ll get better and that your neighbors won’t call the cops (…maybe not that part). Dejectedly you toss the damn thing aside as your blood pressure peaks and you call it a night. The next day though, your fingers move with just a bit less resistance, and so it goes. Small, almost unnoticeable improvements, adding to one another.</p>

        <p>I’ve been sitting on the sidelines as a technology observer for far too long. I think I became interested in finally learning how to develop software after seeing so many simple ideas catch like wildfire in people’s imaginations. It’s a seductive idea to believe that an idea can be broadcast to millions so easily today - something that was unfathomable but only a century ago.<br>I think Fullstack will be a significant challenge, but a worthwhile one. I have always had a strong respect for the builders, not the talkers. It’s important to me for that reason to become a builder myself, and a spectator no longer.<br>That being said, what do I want to build? I’m interested in education, transportation, entertainment (films specifically), and music. I definitely have ideas in each of those categories, but they all need further development. I love tools that make tedious processes much more fluid, efficient, and if possible: automated. I’ll keep an eye open as I learn more about software development.<br>Regarding my current career as a management consultant; I work with software engineering teams all the time. Quite amazingly, a lot of them work without quality standards, in poorly managed environments, and with very bad leadership. Often times, I am responsible for implementing these governance models on teams that don’t have any, so learning the art of software development seems like the logical next step for me in my current career. I think it is profoundly more relevant than other graduate degrees.<br>Regardless of where this takes me, I am excited about the possibilities.<br>Action versus observation… Always.</p>
